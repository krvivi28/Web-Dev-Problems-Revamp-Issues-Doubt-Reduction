# Fitness Tracking Application: Goal Achievement Notification

## Introduction:

As part of a fitness tracking application, your current task is to complete the implementation of the 'addExercise' function. This function is integral to a fitness tracker class, and it updates the progress based on the calories burned during an exercise. Importantly, if the updated progress meets or exceeds the set goal, the function should emit a "goalReached" event. Additionally, to motivate users, a congratulatory message needs to be sent upon reaching the fitness goal. Your objective is to implement the necessary functionality to track progress, emit events, and send the congratulatory message.

## Objectives:

1. Implement the 'addExercise' method within the fitness tracker class. This method should update the progress based on the calories burned during an exercise. If the updated progress meets or exceeds the set goal, emit a "goalReached" event.
2. Set up a listener to send a congratulatory message when the goal is reached.

## Expected Output:

Upon successful completion, the 'addExercise' function should update the progress and emit a "goalReached" event. A congratulatory message saying "Congratulations! You have reached your fitness goal" should be sent to the user.

## Notes/Hints:

1. Ensure that the 'addExercise' function correctly updates the progress.
2. Research how to emit events in your chosen programming language.
3. Explore examples of sending messages to users to understand the required implementation.
