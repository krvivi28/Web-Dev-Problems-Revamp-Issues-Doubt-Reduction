# Implementing Random Number Cookie Middleware

## Introduction:

In a game developed by a programmer, the server generates a random number, stores it in a cookie, and allows users to guess the number. User authentication is a prerequisite, limiting participation to logged-in individuals. The required implementations, including user login, signup, and authentication, are already in place. Assistance is now needed to implement the necessary express-session. Additionally, support is required to complete the middleware "generateRandomNumber" inside the file "middleware/generateRandomNumber.js".

## Objectives:

1. Implement the necessary Express Session to manage and maintain user sessions in the application.
2. Review and understand each endpoint and its respective controller for a comprehensive understanding of the existing implementations.
3. Complete the implementation of the middleware "generateRandomNumber" to generate a random number between 1 and 10 and set this number in cookies with the name 'randomNumber'.
   - Note:
     - This random number is set as a cookie whenever a user logs in to our website.
