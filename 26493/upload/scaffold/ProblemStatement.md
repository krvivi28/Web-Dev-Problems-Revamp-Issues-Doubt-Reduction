# Blogging Platform - File Management Module

## Introduction:

In the provided ES6 module named 'blogActions.js,' two functions are expected: 'writeBlog' and 'publishBlog.' These functions are vital for a real-world blogging platform where users can write and publish their blogs. The 'writeBlog' function should append a user's blog data to a specified file path, while the 'publishBlog' function should retrieve and return the content of a specified file.

## Objectives:

1. Implement the 'writeBlog' function to accept a file path and user's blog, appending it to the specified file.
2. Implement the 'publishBlog' function to accept a file path and return the content of the specified file.

## Expected Output:

The 'writeBlog' function should successfully append the user's blog to the specified file path. The 'publishBlog' function should effectively retrieve and return the content of the specified file, facilitating its display or further processing.

## Requirements:

Implement the module using ES6 syntax, without requiring a change in the file extension (.mjs).

## Notes/Hints:

Consider using the fs module for file operations in Node.js.
